# Analyze with Startosphere chosing the treshold t_w with train/test method

# Analyze the performance impact of the Suffix in a deeper way

# Perform new trainings with the FlashStart domains.

# The domain names are about 160 000. Use some reinforcement learning technique.

# Investigate some solution which consider the number of occurence of a domain

For example, if we are in a centralized DNS server of a small/medium/big company, if the same domain comes from two different terminal then the probability that it will be malicious is low becuase of the DGA nature.

## Notes

Like flashstart, there are a lot of services that could provide a check over Domains integrity.

We need to focus to approaches that doesn't rely on blacklisting except for assured domain names (like Google, ...).

## Can we generate a dataset from the available domain names

Is it so important if a domain name appeare in a stratosphere terminal or in another?

We only need to check the capability of the neural network to see some anomaly in a centralized way.
