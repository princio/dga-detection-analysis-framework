# PSLREGEX - C

This subfolder of `pslregex` is used to:
- write in **C** a method that given a domain name is capable of retrieve the `tld`, `icann` and `private` suffixes.
- write many methods which given a file containing a list of domain names:
    - Parse it (including other information like the type *bening/malicious* of the domain).
    - Generate an `X` file where each domain name row is extended with other domain name versions relative to the each (`tld/icann/private`) manipulation.


## /analyzer (utile?)

> sembra non fare nulla, si guardi generator

In analyzer there are the c-files needed to parse the file coming from different sources like:
- flashstart
- stratosphere (incomplete)
- univpm training dataset

## /generator

There are c-files needed to generate files with the suffixes made explicit.

It works for two different sources:
- flashstart file of 1707
- training dataset of univpm


## /suffixes

The most important files, which reads the _iframe.csv_ generated by the python script and build up a trie structure with search function.

- `parser.c/h` read the _iframe.csv_ generated by the python script building an `Suffix**` array.
- `trie.c/h` use `Suffix**` array populating a trie structure of suffixes.
